     <h1>Introduction to Periodic Chemistry</h1>
     <p>An element is a substance only made of only one kind of atom. e.g. 
        pure gold, is made up of only gold atoms</p><br>
     <p>
     There are 92 different natural elements known to man and 26 man made,
      meaning uranium is the last natural element in the periodic table, any element after uranium is man made.<br>

   <p>These elements are form under three different kind: <br>
     <ul>
        <li><span>Metals</span>, are found on the left-side of the periodic table,
             if look at the periodic table metals are all the ones on the left-side of the ones shaded <span>pinkish</span>.
            They are usual solid-shiny object in room temperature that are good electric and heat conductors, and malleable (They do not break when being hit by a harder object).</li>
        <li><span>Non-metals</span>, are the ones on the right-right of the ones shade pinkish,
        most of them are gases and liquid in room temperature, they are the opposite of malleable which is brittle (The solid ones break easily even when being hit by a harder object),
    Most of them such as Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur are the backbone of all living things such as humans, trees, microorganisms and animals.</li>
        <li><span>Metalloids</span>, are all the ones shaded pinkish, they contain properties of both metals and non-metal. e.g. they are shiny like metals and brittle like non-metals and are semi-conductor, meaning they conduct electricity but not as good as metals.
        Good example of a metalloid is Silicon, which is the backbone of the chips powering our smart-phones.</li>
        <li>And then, there is <span>Hydrogen</span>, which is so special, it can behave like metals or non-metals depending on the situation.</li>
     </ul>

     <h1>Atoms</h1>
     <p>Are the most basic form of everything that exist in the universe.
        They are made of protons and neutrons found inside the nucleus,  and electrons that orbits around the nucleus.
     </p><br>
     <ul>
        <li><span>Protons</span>, are positively charged particles found inside the nucleus and their number is used to represent the atomic number of every element found in the periodic table,
            because unlike neutrons and electrons, their number per each atom is always the same and and are represented with p<sup>+</sup> symbol.</span> 
           </li>
        <li><span>Neutrons</span>, are particles found inside the nucleus, they have no charge, play a vital part in keeping the nucleus intact by preventing protons from repelling one another,
             being attracted to electrons orbiting the nucleus and they are responsible for formation of <span>Isotopes. 
</li>
        <li><span>Electrons</span>, are negatively charged particles found outside the nucleus of an atom, they play a crutial part in chemical bonding and are represented with e<sup>-</sup> symbol</li>
       
     </ul>
</p> 
<p>Atoms have what called <span>electron configuration </span>, the maximum number of electrons each shell can have on its orbit. for better understanding, visualize our solar system, the sun would be like the nucleus, 
    the orbits of each planet would be the shells and planets would be the electrons. However, the orbits would have more than one planet. 
To find how many electrons each orbit can hold, use this equation: </p><br>
<ul>
    <li>e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(n)</sub> = 2n<sup>2</sup>, n represents shell number. 
    For the second shell to have electrons, the first shell needs to be full, for the third shell to have electrons, the second shell needs to be full first</li>
  
    
    <li><h1>Using the equation above let's found how many electrons the first orbit can hold:</h1> <br>
        e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(n)</sub> = 2n<sup>2</sup><br>
        e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(1)</sub> = 2(1)<sup>2</sup><br>
        e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(2)</sub> = 2(1)<br>
        e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(1)</sub> = 2 e<sup>-</sup> <br>
        Therefore, the first shell can only hold a maximum two electrons.</li>


        <li><h1>How about the second shell?</h1> 
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(n)</sub> = 2n<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(2)</sub> = 2(2)<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(2)</sub> = 2(4)<br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(2)</sub> = 8 e<sup>-</sup> <br>
            The second shell can only hold a maximum eight electrons.</li>
           
        

        

        <li><h1>How about the third shell?</h1> 
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(n)</sub> = 2n<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(3)</sub> = 2(3)<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(3)</sub> = 2(9)<br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(3)</sub> = 18 e<sup>-</sup> ,<br>
            The third shell can only hold a maximum eighteen electrons.
        </li>

        <li><h1>How about the forth shell?</h1> 
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(n)</sub> = 2n<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(4)</sub> = 2(4)<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(4)</sub> = 2(16)<br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(4)</sub> = 32 e<sup>-</sup><br>
            The third shell can only hold a maximum thirty two electrons.
        </li>

        <li><h1>How about the fifth shell?</h1> 
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(n)</sub> = 2n<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(5)</sub> = 2(5)<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(5)</sub> = 2(25)<br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(5)</sub> = 50 e<sup>-</sup><br>
            The third shell can only hold a maximum fifty electrons.
        </li>

        <li><h1>How about the sixth shell?</h1> 
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(n)</sub> = 2n<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(6)</sub> = 2(6)<sup>2</sup><br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(6)</sub> = 2(36)<br>
            e<sup>-</sup> for Shell<sub>(6)</sub> = 72 e<sup>-</sup><br>

             <h1>Valence electrons and valence shell</h1>
             <p>Due to electron configuration and number of electrons,
             valence electrons and valence shells are formed by every element,
              valence electrons are electrons found in the outermost shell of element and that outermost shell is called valence shell. <br>
            e.g. <br>
            <img src ="carbon electron config.jfif" alt="" width="60%"> <br>
            <span>Carbon</span> has 6 electrons in its natural state, so based on that and electron configuration of 2, 8, 18, 32, 52 and 72, 
            carbon has two shells with first one having 2 electrons and second one with 4. Therefore, the second shell of carbon is the valence shell, with 4 valence electrons. <br>
            <img src="phosphorus-electron-configuration.png" alt="" width="60%"> <br>
         <span>Phosphorus</span> has 15 electrons in its natural state, so based on that and electron configuration of 2, 8, 18, 32, 52 and 72, 
         Phosphorus has three shells with first one having 2 electrons, second one with 8 and third one with 5 electrons . Therefore, the third shell of Phosphorus is the valence shell, with 5 valence electrons. <br>

         <h1>So, why do we care so much about valence shells and valence electrons?</h1>
        <p>Well, they play a vital part in chemical bonding, knowing the valence shell and valence electrons can help you predict how two elements will react with each other.</p>
           
        </p>

            <h3>Octet rule </h3>

            <div class="donotdisplay">&times;</div>
            
             <h1>What is electronegativity</h1>
             <p>Electronegativity is the ability for an element to attract electrons to itself from other elements,
                the more you go to the right of the periodic table, the higher the electronegativity gets and the higher you are on the periodic table,
                the higher the electronegativity compared the one below you.  <br></p> 

                <p>Therefore, Non-metals overall have a higher electronegativity than Metals and Metalloids,
                    and the non-metals at the top of the periodic table, have a higher electronegativity than the one below them. <br></p>
             
               E.g. <br>

               <p><span>Flourine</span> has the highest electronegativity of them all, because it is on the far-right and top of the periodic,
                 followed by <span>Oxygen</span>, because oxygen is right before Flourine and on top of its group.</p>

                 <p>So,
                    <ul>
                        <li>Valence shell</li>
                        <li>Valence electrons</li>
                        <li>Octet rule</li>
                        <li>Electronegativity</li>
                    </ul> 
                    are four of the element's properties that plays a crucial role in chemical bonding:</p>
                 <p>If the element's valence shell is the second shell and have three or less valence electrons, 
                    that element have a low electronegativity and will not try to achieve the octet rule, instead it will try to get rid of its second valence shell and become like helium. </p>
                    
                    <p>If the element's valence shell is equal to or greater to second shell, the element would try to achieve the octet rule by either gaining or losing electrons on its valence shell. 
                        </p>

            <h1>Chemical bonding</h1>

            <p>Chemical bonding occurs due to the desire to have a full valence shell. 
                The ones with 5 or less overall electron in their naturak state would try to have their first shell as their valence shell by losing electrons
                 and one with 6 or more overall electrons, (from <span>Oxygen</span> upward) in natural state will try to achieve the octet rule by either losing or gaining electrons.  </p> <br>
            
             <h1>Ionic Chemical</h1>
             <p>Involves the transfer of electrons from low electronegativity, three or less valence electrons elements to high electronegativity, four or more valence electrons elements. 
                Hence, usual from metals to non-metals. The electronegativity difference  is usual greater 1.70 units.  <br></p> 

                <p>E.g. <br>

                Beryllium oxide (Be<sup>2+</sup>O<sup>2-</sup>), Beryllium has 4 overall electrons on its natural state, two shells (first shell has two electrons and the second one has two electrons (valence electrons)), low electronegativity of 0.57 units. Beryllium therefore desires the helium state. </p><br>
                <p>Oxygen on the other hand has 8 overall electrons on its natural state, two shells (first shell has two electrons and the second one with 6 ), high electronegativity of 3.44 units. Oxygen therefore desires the octet state. </p><br>
                <p>Thus, when they close to each other, Beryllium will give away its two electrons to oxygen, and beryllium will only left with one filled first shell with two electrons, achieving the helium state with 2 valence electrons (with the first shell becoming its valence shell). </p><br>
                <p>Oxygen will gain the two electrons, achieving the octet state with 8 valence electrons.</p>
                  <p>By the way, the electronegativity between Oxygen and Beryllium is 2.87 units</p>

            <h1>London Dispersion Forces</h1>

            <p>Are formed by atoms at their natural state, as the electrons orbits the nucleus, 
                these electrons sometimes they find themselves all or most of them on the left-side of thier atom atom making that side partially negative and the right-side partially positive and vice versa.  </p> <br>

                <p>So if there is a close by atom on the left, that atom's electrons will repelled to the left also (Due to the like-charges repel effect), 
                causing that close by atom's right side to be partially positive, causing an attraction between these two atoms (Due to the opposite-charges attract effect). This can therefore cause a domino effect throughout all close by atoms.  </p>
            <p>This force is sometimes called an induced dipole-induced dipole attraction or temporal dipole attraction.</p>
            <p>Partial charge is represented by greek delta and the charge:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Partial negative = &delta;<sup>-</sup></li>
                <li>Partial positive = &delta;<sup>+</sup></li>

<h3>Bond polarity</h3>

</div>
<div class="polarity notes">
    <div class="leave">&times;</div>
    <h1>Bond Polarity</h1>

    <p> It is when a molecule has two different charges on its opposite sides, 
        in covalent bonded molecules, this happens when the sharing of electrons is highly uneven due to too much difference in their electronegativity.</p> <br>
        <p>Therefore, covalent bonds can be differentiated into two, non-polar and polar covalent bonds.  
        </p> <br>

       
    <ul>
        <li><span>Non-polar covelant bonds</span> : The electronegativity difference is between 0.00 and 0.40 units. </li>
        <li><span>Polar covelant bonds </span> : The electronegativity difference is between 0.41 and 1.70 units. The closer the difference to 1.70, the higher polarity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>On the other hand, all ionic bonded molecules are polar, since one atom gives away its electrons and becomes positively due to more number of protons compared to electrons, 
        and the one that receives the electron/s becomes negatively charged due to now having more electrons than protons.  </p>
