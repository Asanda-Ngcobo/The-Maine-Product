            <p>A Number of electrons that passes a certain point in a circuit per second and is measured in Amps. <br></p>
         <p> As said before 1 coulombs = 6.25 x 10^18 electrons, therefore 1 amp = 1 Coulumbs per second (1C/s), 3 Amps = 3 Coulumbs per second (3C/s)

        <h1>Electric conductor</h1>
        <p>For current to flow, an electric conductor is needed, something that allows the flow of charge (electric current) in one or more directions through the movement of electrons in one direction or back and forth. </p>

            <h1>What is Voltage</h1>
            <p>As said before in the previous section of electrostatics, voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points
                e.g. if point A has an electric potential of 15 volts and point B has an electric potential of 60 volts,
            then the Voltage is 48 Volts. <br></p>
         <p>Therefore a battery of 9 volts, its negative terminal has an electric potential 9 Volts lower than that of the positive terminal.
        </p>
        <p>To understand what is the electric potential, you can click below to check out our electrostatics section. </p>

           <h1>Increasing voltage without increasing current</h1>
            <p>To increase voltage you can connect batteries in series.</p><br>
          <h1>Increasing the Current</h1>
          <p>To increase current you can connect batteries in parallel.</p>
          <h1> Conventional current vs electric current </h1>
          <p>In conventional current, it is from positive to negative

            <h1>Ohm's law</h1>
            <p>Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance across two points.</p>
            <p>And can be mathematically represented as follows:</p>
            <p>I = V/R</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li><span>I</span> is Current of the system</li>
                <li><span>V</span>  is Voltage of the system</li>
                <li><span>R</span>  is total resistance of the system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This Hence, represents the basic relationship between these three important components of an electric system or circuit.</p>
            <p>The current is therefore highly dependent on voltage and resistance, for example, in general increasing the voltage should increase the current, and increasing the resistance should decrease the current.</p>
            <p>Looking at this in terms of forces, <span>voltage</span>
                 would the applied force, <span>Current</span> would the velocity and <span>resistance</span> would be the frictional force.</p>

            <h1>The effects of connecting resistors in series </span> </h1>
            <p>When resistors are connected in series, all resistors experience the same current but the voltage is divided amongst all resistors, 
                 e.g:</p>
            <p>Four resistors are connected in series:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li><span>R1</span> = 2 ohms </li>
                <li><span>R2</span> = 4 ohms </li>
                <li><span>R3</span> = 6 ohms</li>
                <li><span>R4</span> = 8 ohms</li>
                <li><span>V</span> of the system = 120 volts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To find how much each resistor reduces voltage, 
                one first needs to find the total current of the circuit by finding the sum of all resistors, Total<sub>resistance</sub> = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 <br>
                 = 2 ohms + 4 ohms + 6 ohms + 8 ohms <br>
                 <span> = 20 hms.</span> <br>
                 Then find the current by: <br>
                  I = V/R <br>
                   = 120 V/20 ohms <br>
                   <span>= 6 Amps.</span> </p>
                   <p>All resistors will experience a current of 6 Amps, now you can find the voltage reduction of each resistor using the current
                    you just calculated (6 Amps) multiplied by the resistance of each resistor.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <span>Voltage reduction</span> at R1 is equal to: <br>
             V = I x R = 6 Amps x 2 ohms <br>
              <span>= 12 volts.</span> <br>
            Hence, if you placed a voltmeter after R1, you'd get a reading of 108 volts. </p>
            <p><span>Voltage reduction</span> at R2 is equal to: <br>
            V = I x R = 6 Amps x 4 ohms <br>
            <span>= 24 volts.</span>
            Hence, R2 will experience a voltage of 108 volts and reduce it by 24 volts and if you placed a voltmeter after R2, you'd get a reading of 84 volts. </p>
            <p><span>Voltage reduction</span> at R3 is equal to: <br>
                 V = I x R = 6 Amps x 6 ohms <br> 
                 <span>= 36  volts.</span>
                Hence, R3 will experience a voltage of 84 volts and reduce it by 36 volts and if you placed a voltmeter after R3, you'd get a reading of 48 volts. </p>
            <p><span>Voltage reduction</span> at R4 is equal to: <br>
                 V = I x R = 6 Amps x 8 ohms <br>
                 <span>= 48 volts.</span>
                  Hence, R4 will experience a voltage of 48 volts and reduce it by 48 volts and if you placed a voltmeter after R4, you'd get a reading of 0 volts. </p>

            Thus, the sum of the voltage reductions should be equal to the voltage of the power source, e.g. The battery.
           
            <h1>The effects of connecting resistors in parallel </h1>
            <p>When resistors are connected in parallel, all resistors experience the same voltage but the current is divided amongst all resistors, 
               e.g:</p>
            <p>Four resistors are connected in parallel:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li><span>R1</span> = 2 ohms </li>
                <li><span>R2</span> = 4 ohms </li>
                <li><span>R3</span> = 6 ohms</li>
                <li><span>R4</span> = 8 ohms</li>
                <li><span>V</span> of the system = 120 volts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To find how much each resistor reduces current, 
                </p>
            <p>Therefore <span>Current</span> at R1 is equal to: <br>
             I<sub>1</sub> = V/R <br>
             = 120 V/2 ohms <br>
            <span>= 60 Amps. </span> <br>
            Hence, if you placed an ammeter after R1, you'd get a reading of 60 Amps </p>
            <p><span>Current </span> at R2 is equal to:<br>
                I<sub>2</sub> = V/R <br>
                 = 120 V/4 ohms <br>
                 <span>= 40 Amps. </span><br>
                 Hence,  if you placed a ammeter after R2, you'd get a reading of 40 Amps </p>
            <p><span>Current</span> at R3 is equal to:
                 I<sub>3</sub> = V/R <br>
                  = 120 V/6 ohms <br>
                 <span>= 20 Amps.</span> 
                 Hence, if you placed a ammeter after R3, you'd get a reading of 20 Amps</p>
            <p><span>Current reduction</span> at R4 is equal to: <br>
                 I<sub>4</sub> = V/R <br>
                 = 120 V/8 ohms <br>
                <span>= 15 Amps.</span>  <br> 
                Hence, if you placed a ammeter after R4, you'd get a reading of 15 Amps</p>

            Therefore, the total current of the system is 135 Amps because the sum of all resistor current readings should be equal to the total current of the circuit.
            <p>Total Resistance: <br>
            1/R<sub>total</sub> = (1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub> + 1/R<sub>3</sub> + 1/R<sub>4</sub>)<sup>-1</sup> <br>
          1/R<sub>total</sub> = (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8)<sup>-1</sup> <br>
        
         Another take away, the more you add resistors in series, resistance goes up, but the more you add resistors in parallel, resistance goes down.

            <h1>What is electric power</span> </h1>
            <p>The rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit (measured in Watt) or the work done by the circuit per second, hence 1 Watt is equivalent to 1 Joules per second.</p>
               
            <p>Power equations:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li><span>P = IV</span></li>
                <li><span>P = I<sup>2</sup> x R</span>  </li>
                <li><span>P = V<sup>2</sup>/R</span></li>
                <li><span>P = -q&#x394;V/t</span></li>
              
            </ul>
            <p> <span>P = I<sup>2</sup> x R</span> and <span>P = V<sup>2</sup>/R</span> are both derived from <span>P = VI.</span>
               </p>
                   <p>Remember, <span>I = V/R</span>, therefore replace <span>I</span> in the Power equation with V/R. <span>P = V/R x V</span>, which is simplified to <span>P = V<sup>2</sup>/R.</span></p>
            <p> <span>V = I x R</span>, therefore replace <span>V</span> in the power equation with I x R. <span>P = I x IR</span>, which is simplified to <span>P = I<sup>2</sup> x R</span>  </p>
          
         <p><span>P = -q&#x394;V/t</span> is derived from electrostatic Electric potential and voltage section, where <span>W = -qΔV.</span> power is workdone per second, therefore <span>Power = -qΔV/t.</span> </p>
