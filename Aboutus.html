   <p>South Africa is a country with a wide economic disparity between the rich and the poor (Spaull, 2015). This inequality, as reported by Graven (2014) and Letseka and Maile (2008), has contributed to unequal educational opportunities among learners from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
     This educational inequality (in terms of access, performance, and resource availability) is particularly evident in mathematics, a subject in which South African learners have consistently fared poorly (Spaull and Kotze, 2015). 
   </p>

   <p>Despite the introduction of the quintile classification of schools and its concomitant funding in education, one wonders whether the wide gap in the academic achievement of learners from different socioeconomic backgrounds is being bridged.
     Evidence abounds (e.g., Makwakwa, 2012; McCarthy & Oliphant, 2013; Spaull & Kotze, 2015) that mathematics in general and some topics, for example, statistics and probability, seem to be difficult topics to learn for most learners in South Africa.</p>
  
   <P>The educational gap hasn't been bridged because those coming from economically stable homes (quintile 4 and 5), still perform exponentially better, due to their access to high-quality education, and textbooks, and on top of that, they have access to private tutors, whilst the disenfranchised kids of quintile 1 to 3, still go to schools with fairly low-quality education (sometimes with no math and physics teachers), without access to private tutors and proper textbooks.</P>
    
    <h1>Why Ecolie?</h1>
    
    <p>A survey done by Stats SA in 2020, indicated that at least 75,9% of learners in South Africa have smartphones, 36,1% had access to tablets, and 61,2% to laptops with access to the internet. 
        Ecolie is a free learner's assisting platform aimed at increasing access to quality education by aggregating pre-recorded relevant short tutorial videos, with interactive test questions carefully chosen based on South Africa's curriculum and past exams, allowing students across the country to learn at their own pace, anytime, anywhere.
        Therefore, it was developed as one of the tools that can be used to bridge the educational gap.</p>
